# OSS F# - a detailed introduction

# intro

When I started off developing OSS software with F# the amount of new things I had to
learn simultaneously was slightly overwhelming. Over time through reading source code,
looking at other repos for guidance, and experimentation I got a decent handle on what
you need to make F# software fairly easily. This guide is so you don't have to waste
as much time as I did.

Initially this guide will be for developing F# software on Windows, I may update it with
OSX and Linux later.

A fair amount of this guide will be about setting out your development environment for an
easy experience that saves you time and energy

I'm going to assume you have some familiarity with git and version control in general.
If you don't know much about git I recommend

# tools of the trade

## posh (aka powershell)

cmd on windows is terrible. Even with the improvements in Windows 10, it's a far cry
from anything worth using. Luckily we have posh and with a few modules the posh experience
can be quite enjoyable.




## cmder

If you're not comfortable working from the commandline, it's time to get over that.
My cmd/posh replacement is cmder, I absolutely love it. I have mine configured to
use quake style

## github for windows

I have github for windows configured to use cmder as the default shell


# continuous Integration aka perpetual headaches

## Appveyor

## TravicCI <- fuuuuuuuck them
